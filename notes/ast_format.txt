code:

int myVar = 2 + 4
int myOtherVar = 10 * 2

AST for main.tmt should then look like:

NODE: AST_PROGRAM
    NODE: AST_VARIABLE_DECLARATION
    variable_type = "int"
    variable_name = "myVar"
    assignment = 
        NODE: AST_BINARY_OP
        left = 
            NODE: AST_INTEGER
            value = 2
        right = 
            NODE: AST_INTEGER
            value = 4
        operand = '+'
    NODE: AST_VARIABLE_DECLARATION
    variable_type = "int"
    variable_name = "myOtherVar"
    assignment = 
        NODE: AST_BINARY_OP
        left = 
            NODE: AST_INTEGER
            value = 10
        right = 
            NODE: AST_INTEGER
            value = 2
        operand = '*'
