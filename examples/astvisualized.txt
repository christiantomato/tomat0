AST for main.tmt should look like:

NODE: AST_PROGRAM
    NODE: AST_VARIABLE_DECLARATION
        variable_type = "int"
        variable_name = "myVar"
        assignment = 
            NODE: AST_BINARY_OP
                left = 
                    NODE: AST_INTEGER
                        value = 3
                right = 
                    NODE: AST_INTEGER
                        value = 6
                operand = '+'
    NODE: AST_VARIABLE_DECLARATION
        variable_type = "int"
        variable_name = "myOtherVar"
        assignment = 
            NODE: AST_BINARY_OP
                left = 
                    NODE: AST_INTEGER
                        value = 10
                right = 
                    NODE: AST_INTEGER
                        value = 1
                operand = '-'
